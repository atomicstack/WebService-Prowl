# DESCRIPTION

WebService::Prowl is a interface to Prowl Public API

# SYNOPSIS

This module aims to be a implementation of a interface to the Prowl Public API (as available on http://www.prowlapp.com/api.php)

    use WebService::Prowl;
    my $ws = WebService::Prowl->new(apikey => '40byteshexadecimalstring');
    $ws->verify || die $ws->error();
    $ws->add(application => "Favotter App",
             event       => "new fav",
             description => "your tweet saved as sekimura's favorite",
             url         => "https://github.com/sekimura");

# METHODS

- new(apikey => 40byteshexadecimalstring, providerkey => yetanother40byteshex)

    Call new() to create a Prowl Public API client object. You must pass the apikey, which you can generate on "settings" page https://www.prowlapp.com/settings.php

        my $apikey = 'cf09b20df08453f3d5ec113be3b4999820341dd2';
        my $ws = WebService::Prowl->new(apikey => $apikey);

    If you have been whitelisted, you may want to use 'providerkey' like this:

        my $apikey      = 'cf09b20df08453f3d5ec113be3b4999820341dd2';
        my $providerkey = '68b329da9893e34099c7d8ad5cb9c94010200121';

        my $ws = WebService::Prowl->new(apikey => $apikey, providerkey => $providerkey);

- verify()

    Sends a verify request to check if apikey is valid or not. return 1 for success.

        $ws->verify();

- add(application => $app, event => $event, description => $desc, priority => $pri)

    See example/retrieve to learn how to use retrieve\_token() and retrieve\_apikey()

    success return value looks like this:

        $VAR1 = {
            'success' => {
                'remaining' => '999',
                'resetdate' => '1296803193',
                'code' => '0'
            },
            'retrieve' => {
                'url' => 'https://www.prowlapp.com/retrieve.php?token=fe645f043ce20f7f179c909df062334c14c51a8b',

            }
        };

- retrieve\_apikey(token => $token)
